# DSA_Assignment1
My first DSA Assignment, mostly about linked list, divide and conquer, OOP, etc.
This DSA assignment me to do multiplication, addition, substraction, power and factorial of big numbers presented by a linked list(each node contains a digit).

## Addition
I use the same algorithm as the one I used in Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/
Basically I just adjust a little of my code.

## Substraction
I used the 9' complement to do substraction.
Theoretically I just find the 9's complement of the Minuend and then do the addition.

## Multiplication
At first, I was trying to use the Karasuba Multiplication approach to solve this one. However, It met so much errors, which made me to change to the basic algorithm.

## Power
Just deal with the input in the file .txt, then use loop.

## Factorial
Same as power.
